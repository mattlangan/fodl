## Requirements for Players

- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/) (free account required)
  The link above provides downloads for Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet apps
- A stable internet connection with uploads speeds of at least 1Mbps
- Suggested equipment:
  - Webcam - Unless you're using a phone/tablet we recommend using a webcam over a laptop camera for players streaming from their computer. The [Logitech C615 ($31.99 on Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YW7WCY/) has worked well for us.
  - Camera Mount - Depending on your space you may want to choose between a tripod and a clamp for positioning your webcam or phone.
    - The [Amazon 60-inch tripod ($21.06 on Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-60-Inch-Lightweight-Tripod-Bag/dp/B005KP473Q) has worked well for us.
    - If you prefer to place your webcam on a shelf or some other permanently-elevated structure then we recommend the [Smartree Flexible Mount ($17.99 on Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JKWZADU). Even though the product says it is for Logitech webcams its universal 1/4" threading should work on any standard webcam that has a threaded bottom.
    - :alert: If you are mounting a phone on either of the mounts above you will require a phone clamp adapter such as the [DaVoice Cell Phone Tripod Adapter ($6.95 on Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OS9E6AO). There are many similar adapters and we suggest you take note of the position of your phone's buttons before choosing one to make sure that the adapter can be positioned around them.
